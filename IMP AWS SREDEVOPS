Hereâ€™s a concrete guide to how AWS is used in DevOps/SRE roles, tailored for 3.5+ years of experience, covering real-time tasks, CLI commands, use cases, and top interview questions and answers:

âœ… Where AWS is Used in DevOps/SRE â€“ Real-Time Use Cases
Area	Purpose	Real-Time Example	Tools/Commands
1. EC2 (VMs)	Hosting apps, jobs, agents	Deploy Jenkins, Nginx, monitoring agents	aws ec2 describe-instances, start-instances
2. S3 (Storage)	Backup, artifact storage, static site	Store logs, Terraform state files, app assets	aws s3 cp, ls, sync, lifecycle policies
3. IAM	Access management	Role-based access to EC2, S3, Jenkins	aws iam create-role, attach-policy, sts assume-role
4. CloudWatch	Monitoring, alerting, logs	CPU alerts, Lambda logs, metrics dashboard	Alarms, aws logs tail, metric filters
5. Lambda	Serverless automation	Auto cleanup old files, resize images	aws lambda invoke, triggers from S3/CloudWatch
6. VPC	Networking, security	Create secure subnets, NAT gateways	aws ec2 create-vpc, describe-subnets
7. CloudFormation / Terraform	Infra as Code (IaC)	Deploy entire app stack	IaC pipelines with Git + CI
8. ELB / ALB	Load balancing web apps	Blue-green deployment setup	aws elbv2 describe-load-balancers
9. Route53	DNS, health checks	Map domains, failover routing	aws route53 change-resource-record-sets
10. CodePipeline + CodeDeploy	CI/CD pipeline	Auto-deploy app after code push	Setup via console or YAML

ðŸ”§ Common AWS CLI Commands â€“ DevOps/SRE
bash
Copy
Edit
# EC2 list
aws ec2 describe-instances

# S3 upload
aws s3 cp file.txt s3://my-bucket/

# IAM role
aws iam list-roles

# CloudWatch logs
aws logs tail /aws/lambda/my-fn --follow

# Create Security Group
aws ec2 create-security-group --group-name mysg --description "My SG"
ðŸŽ¯ DevOps/SRE Interview Questions â€“ AWS Focus (with Answers)
âœ… Q1: How do you manage credentials securely in AWS?
A:

Use IAM roles for services (e.g., EC2 instance roles).

Use Secrets Manager or SSM Parameter Store for storing credentials.

Never hardcode credentials; use aws configure for local dev, and roles in prod.

âœ… Q2: How do you monitor your EC2 instance for high memory and CPU?
A:

Use CloudWatch agent to push memory metrics (default is CPU only).

Create CloudWatch alarms for thresholds (e.g., CPU > 80%).

Use cloudwatch:GetMetricData, custom dashboards, and SNS for alerts.

âœ… Q3: How do you implement zero-downtime deployment on AWS?
A:

Use ALB with target groups for blue-green deployment.

Use CodeDeploy with EC2 or Lambda and set deploymentType: BLUE_GREEN.

Route traffic gradually using weighted routing in Route53.

âœ… Q4: What's the difference between Security Groups and NACLs?
A:

Security Groups = stateful, instance-level firewall.

NACLs = stateless, subnet-level firewall.

SGs are evaluated per-instance; NACLs apply at subnet border.

âœ… Q5: How do you automate EC2 backup?
A:

Use a Lambda function with a CloudWatch Event Rule.

Create snapshots via:

bash
Copy
Edit
aws ec2 create-snapshot --volume-id vol-xxxxx
Use AWS Backup service for scheduled backups.

âœ… Q6: How do you ensure S3 bucket is not public?
A:

Use Block Public Access settings on the bucket.

Use IAM policy conditions: "aws:PrincipalOrgID" or "aws:SourceVpc".

Use s3:GetBucketPolicyStatus to verify.

âœ… Q7: How do you troubleshoot an EC2 instance not accessible via SSH?
A:

Check SG and NACL rules (port 22).

Ensure key pair is correct.

Use EC2 serial console or SSM Session Manager for root cause.

âœ… Q8: How do you handle blue/green deployments using ALB?
A:

Create two target groups (blue & green).

Register EC2 instances (or containers) to each group.

Use ALB rules or Route53 weights to switch traffic gradually.

âœ… Q9: Whatâ€™s the role of CloudWatch in DevOps/SRE?
A:

Log aggregation (CloudWatch Logs).

Metrics for CPU, memory, disk, Lambda, etc.

Alerts (SNS integration).

Dashboards for observability.

âœ… Q10: Whatâ€™s the difference between CloudFormation and Terraform?
Feature	CloudFormation	Terraform
Language	JSON/YAML	HCL
Vendor Lock	AWS only	Multi-cloud
State Mgmt	Managed by AWS	Local or remote state file
Community Modules	Limited	Huge registry
Change Preview	Change Sets	terraform plan

ðŸ“Œ DevOps Resume Points â€“ AWS & SRE
Deployed scalable, monitored EC2-based applications using ALB, ASG, and SSM.

Automated CI/CD using AWS CodePipeline, CodeBuild, and CodeDeploy.

Created IAM roles and policies for fine-grained access control across services.

Implemented log shipping and metrics using CloudWatch agent and dashboards.

Automated daily backups using Lambda + CloudWatch events for S3 and EC2 snapshots.
